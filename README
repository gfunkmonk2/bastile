Bastile: a Mate encryption interface.

Bastile is a graphical interface for managing and using encryption keys. 
Currently it supports PGP keys (using GPG/GPGME) and SSH keys. Its goal is to 
provide an easy to use Key Management Tool, along with an easy to use interface 
for encryption operations.

Bastile is integrated into the MATE Desktop Environment and allows users to 
perform operations from their regular applications, like caja or pluma.

For more detailed information about features and their uses, see the included 
help manual or the homepage.

After installing, please give us feedback by subscribing to the bastile-user
mailing list, posting a message to the forums on sourceforge, or submitting 
feature requests or bugs to bugzilla.mate.org.

See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to install Bastile.
