If you want to hack or commit something to bastile, please first send patches to 
bastile-list@mate.org or submitted on bugzilla.mate.org if possible.

For a todo list, first check bugzilla, then look at TODO. Bugzilla is also updated 
with possible enhancements and any current bugs.

Here is a description of the modules:

 o daemon: Various background servers and processes run in this daemon including
   the gpg agent, dbus server, etc...
 
 o data: Data files that need to be processed. Current this is just schemas. They 
   are here because there will be multiple schemas files to separate the app and 
   pgp settings.

 o libbastile: Common static library of code for bastile. Any code that is depended 
   on by multiple modules, such as src/ and plugins/caja, is placed here. 
   Currently this includes BastileContext & keys, operations, and common dialogs.

 o src: The key manager program. This currently includes the main window & dialogs.


USING THE GPG EXECUTABLE DIRECTLY

Unless absolutely necessary bastile limits itself to using the functionality 
found in the GPGME library. This is to prevent maintenance, versioning, syntax
and regression problems that arise from parsing the gpg executable output 
directly. 

In some cases the GPGME doesn't have a given feature that is necessary for 
Bastile's operation. This may be due to the GPGME developers not having 
implemented that feature yet, or refusal to implement a given feature. In 
these cases direct use of GPG is permitted. Such cases must be documented 
below, and must be discussed before hand on the bastile-devel mailing list.

 o bastile-agent implements a gpg-agent compatible assuan interface. It also
   depends on figuring out where the GPG home directory is and modifying 
   GPG options (see below).
   - agent/*
   
 o The Backup Keyrings feature accesses the ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg and 
   ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg files directly. 
   - src/bastile-key-manager.c
   
 o There is code which modifies the ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf GPG configuration file. 
   - libbastile/bastile-gpg-options.c
   
 o Photo ID support
   - gpgme_op_edit state machine in libbastile/bastile-pgp-key-op.c 
   
 o Export Secret Key Support 
   - libbastile/bastile-gpgmex.c


DEBUGGING BASTILE

There are a couple of configure switches that you can enable which add
debugging helpers etc...

--enable-debug 
    - Disables optimization
    - Debug info
    - Enables various checks and logging in the code.
    - Makes all Gtk|Glib etc... runtime warnings fatal.
    - Makes all compilation warnings fatal.
    
--enable-fatal-messages
    When used with --enable-debug turns on fatal compile and runtime warnings.

INDENTATION STYLE

  * No gratituous reformatting of code. If you're rewriting much of a function 
    or file it's okay to reformat it, but reformatting for the sake of it isn't 
    a good idea.

    static int 
    function (int x, const char *y) 
    {
        if (func (arg, arg2 + 1, lots, of, very, lengthy, arguments, for 
                  this, function)) {
                  
            switch (val) {
            case XXX:
                break;
            case YYY:
                break;
            default:
                break;
            }
        } else {
            y = y * x + 1;
        }
        
        return func2 (x, y);
    }

  * For consistency we expand tabs into spaces. This means no tabs in files
    unless there's a specific reason for it.
  * Break long lines where possible.
  * Spaces between functions and arguments, or macros and arguments.
  * Spaces before and after most binary operators. 
  * Spaces after most unary operators (including a comma).
  * Brace on same line as block statement. 
  * Single lined block statements don't need braces unless it makes things 
    significantly clearer. 
  * Return value on line before function definition.
  * Brace on line after function definition.
  * '*' goes with variable not type, when declaring a pointer.
  * Function arguments follow the function call on the same line, and if 
    lengthy are (where possible) wrapped to the column of the first brace.
